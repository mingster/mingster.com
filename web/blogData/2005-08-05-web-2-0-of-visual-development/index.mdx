<p>Visual development has been a standard process for many professional web application development team. Since 1995, techniques and tools have been developed and been improved.</p>
<p>We're in the process of taking the basic building blocks to the next level. Ajax style features will certainly be the part of the mix.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php" target="_new"><strong>1. Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications</strong></a><br />Take a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en" target="_new">Google Suggest</a>. Watch the way the suggested terms update as you type, almost instantly. Now look at Google Maps. Zoom in. Use your cursor to grab the map and scroll around a bit. Again, everything happens almost instantly, with no waiting for pages to reload.</p>
<p>Google Suggest and Google Maps are two examples of a new approach to web applications that we at Adaptive Path have been calling Ajax. The name is shorthand for Asynchronous JavaScript + XML, and it represents a fundamental shift in whatâ€™s possible on the Web.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/" target="_new"><strong>Prototype</strong></a><br />Prototype is a JavaScript framework that aims to ease development of dynamic web applications. Featuring a unique, easy-to-use toolkit for class-driven development and the nicest Ajax library around, Prototype is quickly becoming the codebase of choice for Web 2.0 developers everywhere.</p></p>
