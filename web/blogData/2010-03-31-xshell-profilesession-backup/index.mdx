<p><a href="http://www.netsarang.com/products/xsh_detail.html" target="_blank">XShell</a> from NetSarang is a great SSH client that we use. Even one awhile, you might wanna back up all the saved profiles.</p>
<p>The profiles are actually located at: %user_profile%\%username%\AppData\Roaming\NetSarang\Xshell. For example, C:\Users\johnny\AppData\Roaming\NetSarang\Xshell.</p>
<p>You can just copy the directory to where you want to back it up. You can also create sub-directories if you want to manage them a bit.</p>
