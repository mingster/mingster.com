<p>This still stands for release version of Snow Leopard. It also works for USB disk.</p>
<p>update: 2010/8/6:<br />I switch back for <a href="http://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-download/">NTFS-3G</a>, the Apple built-in version is not stable and screw up my partition table. Apple did not enable it for a reason...</p>
