<p>In our recent upgrade from 5.0 to 5.1.47, the new version behaves differently and it screw up character set when user submit info from our web app powered by .NET. </p>
<p>After digging around for a afternoon, this is how to fix it:<br /><code><br />vi /etc/my.cnf<br /></code></p>
<p>And add those lines to the config:<br /><code><br />init_connect='SET collation_connection = utf8_general_ci'<br />init_connect='SET NAMES utf8'<br />default-character-set=utf8<br />character-set-server=utf8<br />collation-server=utf8_general_ci<br />skip-character-set-client-handshake<br /></code></p>
<p>There are other options for collation besides utf8_general_ci such as utf8_unicode_ci. See this article:<br />http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/charset-unicode-sets.html</p>
