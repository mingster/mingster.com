<p>I'm not sure there's a secured way, but adding permission for iis daemon user solve theÂ problem for me.</p>
<p>1. Find out which deamon user your app is using, by looking up App_Pool and secruity section in event log.</p>
<p>2. Give the user permission to read/write access for the eventlog registry entry. To do so, open regedit and navigate to the key:
<pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesEventlog</pre>
<p>. <br />Right click and select Permissions, and add permission for the user.</p>
<p>3. restart iis and give it a try.</p>
