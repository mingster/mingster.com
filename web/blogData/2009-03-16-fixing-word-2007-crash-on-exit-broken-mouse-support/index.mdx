<p>Thanks to <a href="http://joeon.net/post/Fixing-Word-2007-Crash-on-Exit-amp3b-Broken-Mouse-Support!.aspx" target="_blank">Joe Stagner</a> to provide the fix.</p>
<p>I love Office 2007, but recently I've had big problems with Word.</p>
<p>1.) I can't select text.....<br />It seems this is a common problem with a number of add-ins. In this case it was the Word plug-in for Snag-It 8 from TechSmith - when I uninstalled it, mouse support came back. Note that this is not JUST a Snag-It problem. A bit of searching on the web reveals that MANY plug ins can cause this problem.</p>
<p>2.) The more irritating but was that Word always crashes on exit. I tried disabling and removing all the add-ins, deleting all the auto loaded templates, even uninstalling and re-installing Office 2007 with no success. Just about the time I was about to commit to waste my day rebuilding my day - I found the answer in a newsgroup archive.</p>
<p>DO THIS !!!</p>
<p>1. Start Regedit.<br />2. Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Data<br />3. Right mouse click on the "Data" folder and delete it.<br />4. Close Regedit.</p>
<p>POOF - Word 2007 is back to it's awesome self !!<br /><a href="http://joeon.net/post/Fixing-Word-2007-Crash-on-Exit-amp3b-Broken-Mouse-Support!.aspx" target="_blank">http://joeon.net/post/Fixing-Word-2007-Crash-on-Exit-amp3b-Broken-Mouse-Support!.aspx</a></p>
