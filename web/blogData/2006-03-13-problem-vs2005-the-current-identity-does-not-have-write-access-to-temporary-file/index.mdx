<p>I finally powered up again with my newly purchased&nbsp;dual-core laptop, which also enables me to&nbsp;refresh software installations that I've been wanting to do for a long time.&nbsp; As I'm putting things back together, I kept running into this error with my projects:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">The current identity (xxx\ASPNET) does not have write access to 'C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\Temporary ASP.NET Files'. </p>
<p>Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. </font></p>
<p>
<p>Here's a quick fix to the problem (do this only to your dev box):</p>
<p>1. From the framework directory (Usually c:\windows\microsoft.net\framework\v2.0.50727\Config), modify machine.config: </p>
<p><font face="Courier New">&lt;processModel userName="SYSTEM" password="autoGenerated"/&gt;</font></p>
<p>2. Execute this command:</p>
<p>
<p><font face="Courier New">&gt; aspnet_regiis -ga "ASPNET"</font></p>
<p>By applying MS's Web updates (often times including security patches), or putting you box into domain (which I am), the security&nbsp;constriant of your windows install drive got stricted.&nbsp; If you read the prompt from aspnet_regiis carefully, switch -ga is granting the daemon user access to the IIS metabsae and other directories used by ASP.NET, which is exactly what&nbsp;I'm looking to do..</p>
