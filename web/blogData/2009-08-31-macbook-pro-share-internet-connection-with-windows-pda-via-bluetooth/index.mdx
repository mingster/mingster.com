<p>To share 3G connection from PDA to MacBook, here's the steps:</p>
<p>1. Turn on Bluetooth on both devices (MBP and PDA)<br />2. Pair up (if you're not yet done it)<br />3. Start the internet sharing program on PDA<br />4. On MBP, click on the bluetooth icon on the menu bar (assuming you have it on the menu bar), under your PDA device, select "Connect".<br />5. Happy browsing.</p>
<p>My working device is: MBP 990 (OSX 10.5.8), HTC Curise (WM 6.1).</p>
