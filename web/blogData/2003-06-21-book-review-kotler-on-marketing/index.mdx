<p>Part Three: Administrative Marketing - planning and organizing for more effective marketing; evaluating and controlling marketing performance.
<p>Part Four: Transformational Marketing - adapting to the new age of electronic marketing.
<p>Whether you read the book from cover to cover, or add it to your reference library and just read specific sections, you will find it full of useful theories, practical advice and many current examples.</p>
