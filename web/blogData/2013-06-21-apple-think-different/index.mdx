<blockquote><p>Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.</p>
<p>Because they change things. They push the human race forward.</p>
<p>And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.</p>
<p>Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</p></blockquote>
